  <h2 class="twoColFixLtHdr">Candidates for T109 Election (October 2010)</h2>
  <h4>ELECTED POSITIONS:</h4>
  <p>Senior Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>THOMAS LIGGETT</strong>: I'm  a Life Scout and have been actively participating in Troop 109 ever  since I finished Cub Scouts. I have been Patrol Leader for the No Name  Patrol, Assistant Patrol Leader for the Bear Patrol, as well as  Quartermaster. I believe I would be a good Senior Patrol Leader because  I value communication and leading by example. </li>
    <li><strong>DANIEL KOPISCH: </strong>I decided to run for Senior Patrol Leader (SPL). Here are the top five reasons why you should vote for me.<br />
      5) Experience.  I have served three terms as Assistant Senior Patrol Leader (ASPL) and learned which obligations an SPL has.<br />
4) Training. I was the first scout (with my brother) in Troop 109 to   attend the National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) to learn how to   lead in a Boy Scout troop.<br />
3) Insight. I have served Troop 109 in many roles (currently I'm Troop   Guide) and understand the different requirements you have.<br />
2) Focus. In order to see an Eagle Scout project through a Life Scout   needs to put his complete focus on it. I'm basically done with my Eagle   Scout project and can fully focus on leading Troop 109.<br />
1) Guts. I have proven that I'm not afraid to speak up and stand my   ground in the best interest of the scouts. Our troop should be boy led. I   was the only scout who wrote an email to request a discussion of the   adult decision to assign scouts to leadership positions. I also was the   only scout who spoke up during the troop meeting to ensure that we   govern ouselves. <br />
So if you want someone who can stand his ground on your behalf and knows   how to do the job of an SPL then you should vote for me.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Assistant Senior Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CHRISTOPER SCHERM:</strong> I believe that I should be   Assistant Senior Patrol Leader because I have lots of experience with   leadership, over the summer last year I went to NYLT or National Youth   Leadership Training. I have also learned leadership from my successes   and failures as The Bear Patrol Leader which I have held since the last   election.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Bear Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MATT TINYO:</strong> I feel this position is right for me because I am only 3 months away   from getting Life and I can help others out. In the past months I have   been connecting with the younger scouts and listening to their ideas.   The last camp called NYLT has helped me become a better leader. Thank   you for taking the time to read this.</li>
    <li><strong>JEREMY CHOW: </strong>I am running for Patrol Leader/Assistant Patrol Leader for the Bear   Patrol. I have been in scouting since first grade, from Cub Scouts to   now. Although I am currently a Star Scout, I am on the path to Eagle   Scout in merit badges, but I need your help to achieve the required   leadership position for advancement. I was Service Coordinator for the   troop over last year, and I only missed one Patrol Leader Council   meeting during that time. Over the summer I also attended the week-long   National Youth Leadership Training with a few fellow scouts of Troop   109, which taught us key strategies in how to lead a group from the   moment it forms to the point where it can succeed without the leader's   guidance. But, no matter who you decide to vote for,  always remember   that  your final decision is up to   you.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Bear Assistant  Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JEREMY CHOW:</strong> I am running for Patrol Leader/Assistant Patrol Leader for the Bear   Patrol. I have been in scouting since first grade, from Cub Scouts to   now. Although I am currently a Star Scout, I am on the path to Eagle   Scout in merit badges, but I need your help to achieve the required   leadership position for advancement.

But, no matter who you decide to vote for,  always remember   that  your final decision is up to   you.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Panther Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>STEVEN SHIMBO:</strong> I feel I am qualified because I have been an assistant-patrol leader   and an assistant-senior patrol leader in the past.  I am also currently a   Life Scout and I am close to my Eagle Rank so I have a lot of   experience in the Troop.  I feel I connect well with younger children   and that I can lead the Panther Patrol quite well.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Panther Assistant  Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JEREMMIE LAI: </strong>Yes, you received my last email. But this time, I have changed my   leadership position proposal. Instead of Merit Badge Coordinator, I am   running for Assisstant Patrol leader of the Panther Patrol. Again, I   have attended National Youth Leadership Training and have been in this   Troop since 2006. I am currently a Life scout and working on my Eagle   project. In thinking about my Eagle project, I thought about how being   Assistant Patrol Leader would give me more examples to show not only my   Eagle Board of Review my leadership, but the Council representative.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Platypus Patrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>KENDALL LEE</strong>: I support Johnathan Adams for this role, but he has chosen not to run. I am currently a Life Scout and am qualified for this position.  I was   Assistant Patrol Leader at Camp Oljato, and I have been the Assistant   Patrol Leader for the Platypus Patrol for the last 4 months.  In this   role, I organized the Rifle shooting activity for the Platypus Patrol   recently, and I'm planning the Mountain Man Rendezvous activity   (including rank advancement) in mid-October.  I've also planned several   ten mile hikes.  I appreciate your support.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Platypus Assistant  Partrol Leader</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JOHNATHAN ADAMS:</strong> I have some leadership experience, and I am pretty well versed in the   Tenderfoot to First Class requirements.  I would prefer to help others   to Eagle rather than to get there myself.  Because of my leadership   experience and focus on others, I feel I would be good at being   Assistant Patrol Leader.  So, please vote for me.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>OTHER T109 POSITIONS</h4>
  <p>Troop Guide</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ALEXANDER HUDSON:</strong>  I   have been a Boy Scout since I was 11. I am currently First Class. I am   qualified for this position because I went to Camp Cutter and Camp   Oljato with many of the younger scouts, so I have a general idea of what   the scouts are interested in. I can suggest merit badges that will   appeal to them.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Den Chief</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JEREMY RADER: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Merit Badge Coordinator</p>
<ul>
  <li>None</li>
</ul>
<p>Service Coordinator</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JOE FARNED:</strong> I'm interested in serving as your Troop Service Coordinator for the   upcoming Scouting season. In the past, Troop 109 has not been very   &quot;service oriented&quot;. At most, we've participated in two or three   &quot;smaller&quot; projects per year. As Service Coordinator, I would strive to   substantially increase our involvement in service projects. Preferably,   the Troop would participate in a service project – each likely lasting   for a few hours on Sat. or Sun. – once every one or two month(s).   Additionally, if a large enough group was willing to participate, the   Troop would host its own service event or fundraiser. I have served as SPL in the past – a position I held for a full year.   Furthermore, I have also held the positions of Patrol Leader and   Assistant Patrol Leader. I'm passionate about helping the Troop become   more involved in service – a more &quot;service oriented&quot; Troop would benefit   every Scout (especially those of you working on Life and below)! Please   vote for me!</li>
</ul>
<p>Quartermaster</p>
<ul>
  <li>None</li>
</ul>
<p>Webmaster</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KENDALL LEE:</strong> I have  been the Troop Webmaster for two years, and I would like to   continue this position.  The troop website has generated interest from   potential scouts and has become more useful for our troop.  I own and am   proficient in Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 (a software for web design).  My   next plan for the website is to more fully integrate Google Calendars.</li>
